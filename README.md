# Credit Risk Analytics
Consumer Credit is one of the main sources of income for a bank. But that does not mean there is no inherent risk in the consumer credit business, as it is dependent on various factors apart from the consumerâ€™s credit history, like the current Economic climate, Government debt and various other trickle down effects that may put pressure on the clients ability to pay back their debts. Our goal is to reduce this outside risk by creating a model that will only allow us to provide a line of credit to the consumers who are less likely to default on their obligations in tougher times than to provide loans to people who are more likely to default under tougher circumstances.
